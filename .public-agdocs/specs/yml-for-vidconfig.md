generate a yaml based config and a loading method that supplies all parameters to GenerateVideosConfig in main.py. Some methods may be overwritten within main methods (e.g. number of images)

Generate some pytests in ./tests/ that test whether the loaded config loads into the GenerateVideoConfigs object correctly.
