You need to update the video generation logic when video is passed as input to utilize a bucket as an output. 
- This will only occur when --vertex is specified.
- Only utilize bucket for output, keep the input/upload as from local filesystem / local client.
- utilize bucket pre-built bucket: gs://hello-world-123
- no need to add a download, just echo where the video was output to and its name (which should be unique).

- This requires fixing some response syntax which originally was fixed from this error. It should be patched for the time being.
Here's a traceback from a current run at new functionality, what could be wrong? add possible fixes and debugging statements.
> python main.py --vertex video -v data/dump/stadium-1.mp4  'camera continues to pan across the stadium of cheering fans' 
        Using initial video from: data/dump/stadium-1.mp4
        Waiting for video generation to complete...
        File "/home/user/dev/smol-projs/vidstr/main.py", line 96, in generate_video
            video = operation.response.generated_videos[0]
        AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'generated_videos'
- this can also be seen with the result of the debug statement added:
--- DEBUG: Operation object ---
name='projects/aige.../locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/veo-2.0-generate-001/operations/xxxxx7' metadata=None done=True error={'code': 3, 'message': 'Generated video is large, an output storage uri is required.'} response=None result=None
--- END DEBUG ---

use the following documentation of how the vertex-api works to help fix and debug.
