# Updating from v1.X to v2.X[\#](#updating-from-v1-x-to-v2-x)

MoviePy v2.0 has undergone some large changes with the aim of making the
API more consistent and intuitive. In order to do so multiple breaking
changes have been made. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that your
pre-v2.0 programs will not run without some changes.

::: section
## Dropping support of Python 2[\#](#dropping-support-of-python-2)

Starting with version 2.0, MoviePy **no longer supports Python 2**,
since Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Focusing on Python 3.7+
allows MoviePy to take advantage of the latest language features and
improvements while maintaining code quality and security.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to a supported version of Python to
continue using MoviePy.

## `moviepy.editor` suppression and simplified importation[\#](#moviepy-editor-suppression-and-simplified-importation)

Before v2.0, it was advised to import from `moviepy.editor` whenever you
needed to do some sort of manual operations, such as previewing or hand
editing, because the `editor` package handled a lot of magic and
initialization, making your life easier, at the cost of initializing
some complex modules like `pygame`.

With version 2.0, the `moviepy.editor` namespace simply no longer
exists. You simply import everything from `moviepy` like this:

    from moviepy import * # Simple and nice, the __all__ is set in moviepy so only useful things will be loaded
    from moviepy import VideoFileClip # You can also import only the things you really need

:::::

::: section
## Renaming and API unification[\#](#renaming-and-api-unification)

One of the most significant change has been renaming all `.set_` methods
to `.with_`. More generally, almost all the method modifying a clip now
starts by `with_`, indicating that they work 'outplace', meaning they do
not directly modify the clip, but instead copy it, modify this copy, and
return the updated copy, leaving the original clip untouched.

We advise you to check in your code for any call of method from `Clip`
objects and check for a matching `.with_` equivalent.

## Massive refactoring of effects[\#](#massive-refactoring-of-effects)

With version 2.0, effects have undergone massive changes and
refactoring. Though the logic of why and when applying effects remain
globally the same, the implementation changed quite heavily.

If you used any kind of effects, you will have to update your code!

::: section
### Moving effects from function to classes[\#](#moving-effects-from-function-to-classes)

MoviePy version 2.0 introduces a more structured and object-oriented
approach to handling effects. In previous versions, effects were simply
Python functions that manipulated video clips or images. However, in
version 2.0 and onwards, effects are now represented as classes.

This shift allows for better organization, encapsulation, and
reusability of code, as well as more comprehensible code. Each effect is
now encapsulated within its own class, making it easier to manage and
modify.

All effects are now implementing the
[`Effect`](../reference/reference/moviepy.Effect.html#moviepy.Effect.Effect)
abstract class, so if you ever used any custom effect.

If you ever write your own effect, you will have to migrate to the new
object implementation. For more info see [Creating your own
effects](../user_guide/create_effects.html#create-effects).
:::

::: section
### Moving from `clip.fx` to [`with_effects()`](../reference/reference/moviepy.Clip.Clip.html#moviepy.Clip.Clip.with_effects)[\#](#moving-from-clip-fx-to-with-effects)

Moving from function to object also meant MoviePy had to drop the method
`Clip.fx` previously used to apply effects in favor of the new
[`with_effects()`](../reference/reference/moviepy.Clip.Clip.html#moviepy.Clip.Clip.with_effects).

For more info about how to use effects with v2.0, see [Modify a clip
using effects](../user_guide/modifying.html#modifying-effects).
:::

::: section
### Removing effects as clip methods[\#](#removing-effects-as-clip-methods)

Before version 2.0, when importing from `moviepy.editor` the effects was
added as clip class method at runtime. This is no longer the case.

If you previously used effect by calling them as clips method, you must
now use
[`with_effects()`](../reference/reference/moviepy.Clip.Clip.html#moviepy.Clip.Clip.with_effects).

::: section
## Dropping many external dependencies and unifying environment[\#](#dropping-many-external-dependencies-and-unifying-environment)

With v1.0, MoviePy relied on many optional external dependencies, trying
to gracefully fallback from one library to another in the event one of
them was missing, eventually dropping some features when no library was
available. This resulted in complex and hard to maintain code for the
MoviePy team, as well as fragmented and hard to understand environment
for the users.

With v2.0 the MoviePy team tried to offer a simpler, smaller and more
unified dependency list, with focusing on `pillow` for all complex image
manipulation, and dropping altogether the usage of `ImageMagick`,
`PyGame`, `OpenCV`, `scipy`, `scikit`, and a few others.
:::

::: section
## Removed features[\#](#removed-features)

Sadly, reducing the scope of MoviePy and limiting the external libraries
mean that some features had to be removed, if you used any of the
following features, you will have to create your own replacement:

- `moviepy.video.tools.tracking`

- `moviepy.video.tools.segmenting`

- `moviepy.video.io.sliders`
:::

::: section
## Miscellaneous signature changes[\#](#miscellaneous-signature-changes)

When updating the API and moving from previous libraries to `pillow`,
some miscellaneous changes also happen, meaning some methods signatures
may have changed.

You should check the new signatures if you used any of the following:

- `TextClip` some arguments named have changed and a path to a font file
  is now needed at object instantiation

- `clip.resize` is now `clip.resized`

- `clip.crop` is now `clip.cropped`

- `clip.rotate` is now `clip.rotated`

- Any previous `Clip` method not starting by `with_` now probably start
  with it

::: section
## Why all these changes and updating from v1.0 to v2.0?[\#](#why-all-these-changes-and-updating-from-v1-0-to-v2-0)

You may ask yourself why were all these changes introduced? The answer
is: time.

MoviePy have seen many evolution since his first release and have became
kind of a complex project, with ambitions sometimes too important in
regards to available manpower on the development team. Over time, as in
any project, inconsistencies have been introduced in order to support
new functionalities without breaking current API, and some initial
choices no longer reflected the current state of things.

Due to multiple factors, MoviePy have also undergone a long period of
time during which the main version distributed through PiPy diverged
from the GitHub distributed version, introducing confusion and chaos.

In a global effort to simplify future development and limit confusion by
providing a unified environment, it has been decided to release a new
major version including the many evolutions than happened over the
years, which meant breaking changes, and so a new major version released
was required.

For anyone interested in how and why all of these things have been
decided, you can find a lot of the discussion that went into this in
GitHub issues [#1874](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/1874),
[#1089](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/1089) and
[#2012](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/2012).
